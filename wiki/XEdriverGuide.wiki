= Introduction =

XE driver is a module plugin which is used to implement various features without modifying the module. For instance, if you use oAuth for the login process of XE based website, you can create XE drivers for each oAuth provider to implement the member module's main processes such as signing up, and viewing, modifying and deleting member information. Then, the module can support multiple login processes depending on the drivers.

= Structure of XE driver =
The file structure of XE driver is shown below:
{module name}

└ drivers ┬ {module name}Driver.php

	       └ {driver name}
                       ├ {module name}Driver{driver name}.php
                      ├ conf
